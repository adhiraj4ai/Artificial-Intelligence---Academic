DFS starts at start node or location of the problem and explores along its branch first until the goal node is found. If goal node is not found along the choosen branch, backtracking is run i.e. *looks for the goal node among all the children of the current node before using the sibling of this node i.e. expand deepest unexpanded node.*\n","\n","The Depth First Search is implemented using Stack data structure and it is required to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycle.\n","\n","## Algorithm\n","1. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.\n","2. Pop out the vertices from top of the stack and add it to the visited list.\n","3. Expand the visited node and add its adjacent node that are not in the visited list to the top of the stack.\n","4. Repeat 2 and 3 utill goal node is found\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SXeG-vhbowdI"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":125,"metadata":{"id":"LoT_jwxRogKI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649525072379,"user_tz":-345,"elapsed":405,"user":{"displayName":"Rajan Adhikari","userId":"08655444637424927407"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["class DepthFirstSearch:\n","  \"\"\"\n","    Scratch Implementation of Depth First Search in Python\n","  \"\"\"\n","  def __init__(self, graph):\n","    self.graph = graph\n","    self.visited_list = set()\n","    self.visited = {}     #
